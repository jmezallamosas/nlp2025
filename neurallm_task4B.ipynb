    "Your job for this option is to measure the quality of your generated sentences for word-based models. For this option you *must* survey at least 3 people who are __not__ in this course. They need to speak and read the language that you are evaluating, but they need not be native speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will evaluate the quality of the generated sentences in the following way:\n",
    "- Generate 20 sentences from your best word-based neural model. (Value of hyperparameters and n value up to you).\n",
    "- Using the same level of n-gram, pair these sentences with provided sentences from the vanilla n-gram model. If you want to evaluate a model with N != 3, 4, or 5, then you'll need to train your vanilla n-gram model and generate your own comparison sentences. Ignore sentences with \\<UNK\\> in them for even comparison, so you'll need to over-generate to get 20.\n",
    "    - Pair them (roughly) based on sentence length, so that each pair has sentences that are a roughly similar number of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, build a survey. For each pair of (neural LM sentence, vanilla n-ngram LM sentence), you'll ask the survey taker three binary selection questions:\n",
    "1. which sentence is more grammatical?\n",
    "2. which sentence makes more sense, semantically (in meaning)?\n",
    "3. Overall, which sentence do you prefer?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll evaluate your survey results __programmatically__ (export them as a csv). Calculate the following:\n",
    "1. What percentage of neural vs. vanilla n-gram LM sentences were preferred, separated along each of the three dimensions?\n",
    "2. What is [Krippendorff's alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krippendorff%27s_alpha) for your survey data? \n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to use a pre-built python implmenetation of the Krippendorff's alpha calculation, such as [this one](https://pypi.org/project/krippendorff/). Krippendorff's alpha is one way to measure interannotator agreement â€” the extent to which your survey respondants agree with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will submit your survey data (as a csv called `survey_results.csv`) __and__ your paired sentences (`paired.txt`, formatted in a way that is easy to understand) alongside this notebook."
